## Important
Gotta mention that for the run of this code it's necesary to install the GNU Linux C/C++ compiler (MinGW) in order to compile the game.
Run the command: `gcc main.c combat.c functions.c animations.c -o game.exe` to compile into an executable file.

## Update after a while
I was really newbie in that moment so, I really didn't knew about CMake like... at all?
